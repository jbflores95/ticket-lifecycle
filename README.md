<p>

<p>
- Under Tickets, click open, and you should see the ticket we just created.
</p>
- Now, based on the info you see here, do you think its a serious issue?  I'll give you a hint, look at what karen posted. Looks like her employees are no longer able to access the online banking portal. Huge issue.
</p>
- In cases like these its wise to contact Karen if this were a real life issue or have your internal team reach out for an update.
</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

Whew, what a ride! This osTicket lab threw me into the trenches, creating tickets, playing detective to find the root cause, and finally slapping that "Resolved" status on there like a victory stamp. Itâ€™s crazy how much goes into even a "simple" support ticket: SLAs breathing down your neck, making sure Karen in Accounting actually gets her answer, and leaving notes so the next person doesnâ€™t lose their mind retracing my steps. Feels good to see the whole lifecycle from chaos to closure.  
</p>
Heads up! Make sure to always stop your VM's or delete it after you're done. You don't want a surprise bill coming around. ðŸ˜… ðŸ’»
